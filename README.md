- ethers used with "legacy" feature enabled because ganache does not support 1559 txs yet
- EthPool.preTransferAdjustWithheldLiquidity uses msg.sender instead of sender in half of the function. When this is called via transferFrom, this can create a situation where transferring funds between accounts leads to accounts with requestedWWithdrawals > balance, so we can inflate the withheldFunds value without adding more funds
- bug was fixed in this newly deployed version: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x33d5d325db02bff480a37682c4053a73d8323a5af9e8d7dc8b7ab37c1404d3c2
